<li>There are forty students in a class out of which there are 14 who are taking Maths and 29 who are taking Computer. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student from this group is taking only the Computer class?<br/>
a) 40%<br/>
b) 55%<br/>
c) 65%<br/>
d) 70%<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> 60%</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
There are in total of 40 students. 14 are taking Maths and 29 are taking calculus. Therefore there have to be 3 students who are taking both the classes.  So, 29 – 3 = 26 students are taking only Computer. So probability = 26/40 = 13/20 = 65% </p></blockquote>

<li>Find the number, the second digit of which is smaller than its first digit by 4, and if the number was divided by the digit’s sum, the quotient would be 7.<br/>
a) 51<br/>
b) 62<br/>
c) 73<br/>
d) None of these<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> d) None of these</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong> If we consider the number 84, then we get 8 – 4 = 4 and when the sum of digits that is 12 divides the number 84, we get 7.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>If all 6s get inverted and become 9s, between 1 and 100 then by how much will the sum of all numbers change including both?<br/>
a) 300<br/>
b) 330<br/>
c) 333<br/>
d) None of these<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 330</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
For the 6 at the unit place:<br/>
When the digits are changed to 9, each value will increase by 3. Since there are 10 such numbers, so total increase = 10 * 3 = 30<br/>
For the 6 at 10’s place:<br/>
When the digits are changed to 9, each value will increase by 30. Since there are 10 such numbers, so total increase = 10 * 30 = 300<br/>
So the total increase will be 30 + 300 = 330</p></blockquote>

<li>Rajesh and Prabhu went to a bookshop. Rajesh purchased 5 pens, 3 notebooks and 9 pencils and used up all her money. Prabhu purchased 6 pens, 6 notebooks and 18 pencils and paid 50% more than what Rajesh paid. What % of the Rajesh money was spent on pens?<br/>
a) 12.5<br/>
b) 62.5<br/>
c) 75<br/>
d) Cannot be determined<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 12.5</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let the amount spent by Rajesh be ‘x’</p>
<p>According to the question,<br/>
5 pen + 3 notebooks + 9 pecils = x<br/>
and<br/>
6 pens + 6 notebooks + 18 pencils = 1.5x</p>
<p>By solving both the equations we get,<br/>
pens = 0.125x = 12.5%</p></blockquote>

<li>In a group of persons travelling in a bus, 6 persons can speak Tamil, 15 can speak Hindi and 6 can speak Gujarati. In that group, none can speak any other language. If 2 persons in the group can speak two languages and one person can speak all the three languages, then how many persons are there in the group?<br/>
a) 21<br/>
b) 22<br/>
c) 24<br/>
d) 23<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> d) 23</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Assuming the two persons who can speak two languages be Hindi and Tamil and the third person speaks all the three languages.<br/>
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Tamil is 6. Only Tamil = 6 – 2 – 1 = 3<br/>
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Hindi is 15. Only Hindi = 15 – 2 – 1 = 12<br/>
Therefore, the number of people who can speak Gujarati is 6. Only Gujarati = 6 – 1 = 5<br/>
Thus the number of persons who can speak only one language is 3 + 12 + 5 = 20<br/>
Given,<br/>
The number of persons who can speak two languages is 2<br/>
The number of people who speak all three languages is 1<br/>
Therefore the answer is 23.</p></blockquote>

<li>There are 2 trucks facing each other at a distance of 500 cm from each other. Each truck moves forward by 100 cm at a speed of 50 cm/s and then moves backwards by 50 cm at a speed of 25 cm/s. How long will they take to collide?<br/>
a) 12 sec<br/>
b) 16 sec<br/>
c) 13 sec<br/>
d) 14 sec<p></p>
<p>Answer: d) 14 sec</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
If we observe the series carefully running from time = 2 sec and hence,</p>
<p>Moving forward:<br/>
At 2 secs each truck will move to a distance of 100cms</p>
<p>Moving backwards:<br/>
At 4 secs each truck will move to a distance of 50cms</p>
<p>Moving forward:<br/>
At 6 secs each truck will move to a distance of 150cms</p>
<p>Moving backwards:<br/>
At 8 secs each truck will move to a distance of 100cms</p>
<p>Moving forward:<br/>
At 10 secs each truck will move to a distance of 200cms</p>
<p>Moving backwards:<br/>
At 12 secs each truck will move to a distance of 150cms</p>
<p>Moving forward:<br/>
At 14 secs each truck will move to a distance of 250cms and in all 500 cms that are the point they must collide.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>What is the greatest number that will divide 964, 1238 and 1400 and leave a remainder of 41, 31 and 51 respectively?<br/>
a) 71<br/>
b) 58<br/>
c) 64<br/>
d) 79<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 71</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
To reach to the solution we just need to find the HCF of (964 – 41), (1238 – 31), (1400 – 51) = 923, 1207, 1349<br/>
The HCF of 923, 1207 and 1349 = 71</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The average temperature of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were 37°C and on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was 34°C. If the temperature on Thursday was 4/5 th of that of Monday, then what was the temperature on Thursday?<br/>
a) 36 °C<br/>
b) 36.5 °C<br/>
c) 34 °C<br/>
d) 35.5 °C<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 36 °C</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
According to the question,<br/>
Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = 37 °C<br/>
Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday = 34 °C<br/>
Thursday = 4/5 of Monday<br/>
On solving the first two equations and substituting the values from the third condition we get the temperature of Thursday = 36 °C

<li>There are 6 cities, and every city is connected to each other. How many different routes can one trace from A to B, such that no city is touched more than once in any one route?<br/>
a) 72<br/>
b) 65<br/>
c) 60<br/>
d) 48<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 65</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
There must be 1 direct route.<br/>
There are 4 ways to cover 1 city<br/>
There are 4 * 3 = 12 ways to cover 2 cities<br/>
There are 4 * 3 * 2 ways to cover 3 cities<br/>
There are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1  ways to cover 4 cities<br/>
Total ways = 65 ways</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>A secret can be said by only 2 persons in 5 minutes. The same person tells the secret to 2 more persons and so on. How long will take to tell it to tell 768 persons?<br/>
a) 500 min<br/>
b) 50 min<br/>
c) 47.5 min<br/>
d) 49 min <p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) 47.5 min </pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
One person telling to 2 means he takes 2.5 min to tell the secret to 1 person,<br/>
So 1 person telling the truth to another 2 people and the next two telling the truth to the next two who in turn are telling another 2 people and so on…<br/>
Therefore a series is formed of 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16 and so on…<br/>
Therefore a series of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,…, 512<br/>
Till 512 it would take<br/>
Till this will take 45 minutes and now these people i.e., 256 will be telling the truth to only 1 of the total person will be 768,<br/>
Therefore, 45 + 2.5 = 47.5 min</p></blockquote>

<li>Three cubes of edges 6 cms, 8 cms and 10 cms are meted without loss of metal into a single cube. The edge of the new cube will be:<br/>
a) 16 cm<br/>
b) 14 cm<br/>
c) 12 cm<br/>
d) 8 cm<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) 12 cm</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Since the cube is melted so the volume of the new cube must be the same.<br/>
Volume of new cube = Volume of cube 1 + cube 2 + cube 3 = 63 + 83 + 103 = 216 + 512 + 1000<br/>
a^3 = 1728,<br/>
a = (1728)^(1/3) = 12</p></blockquote>

<li>A reduction in the price of mangoes by 20% enables a farmer to purchase 12 more mangoes for Rs. 15. So what could be the price of 16 mangoes before the reduction of the price?<br/>
a) Rs. 9<br/>
b) Rs. 7<br/>
c) Rs. 5<br/>
d) Rs. 6<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) Rs. 5</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
We know that<br/>
Price * Consumption = Expenditure<br/>
and, Consumption = Expenditure Price<br/>
So,<br/>
(15 / 8x) – (15 / x) = 12<br/>
x = (15 * 2) / (12 * 8)<br/>
For 16 Mangoes = [(15 * 2) / (12 * 8)] * 16 = 5 (answer)</p></blockquote>

<li>Aman completes a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 21 km/hr and second half at the rate of 24 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.<br/>
a) 220 km<br/>
b) 234 km<br/>
c) 230 km<br/>
d) 224 km<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> d) 224 km</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
According to the question,<br/>
((1/2)x)/21 + ((1/2)x)/24 = 10<br/>
Solving this equation we get 15x = 168 * 20<br/>
Further x = (168 * 20)/15 = 224 km.</p></blockquote>

<li>There are two alarm clocks ringing at regular intervals of 50 seconds and 48 seconds. If they first beep together at 12 noon, at what time will they beep again together?<br/>
a) 12:10 PM<br/>
b) 12:20 PM<br/>
c) 12:11 PM<br/>
d) 12:12 PM<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 12:20 PM </pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
This can be found by finding the LCM of 48 and 50.<br/>
They will ring together after,<br/>
LCM of 48 and 50 secs.<br/>
48 = 2*2*2*2*3;<br/>
50 = 2*5*5;<br/>
So, LCM = 2*2*2*2*3*5*5 = 1200 secs = 20 min.<br/>
Therefore, they will beep together at 12:20 PM next.</p></blockquote>

<li>Ram purchased 20 dozens of toys at the rate of Rs. 375 per dozen. He sold each one of them at the rate of Rs. 33. What was his percentage profit?<br/>
a) 5.6 %<br/>
b) 4.5 %<br/>
c) 3.5 %<br/>
d) 6.5 %<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 5.6 %</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let’s find the cost price of 1 toy = 375 / 12 = 31.25 rupees.<br/>
Now, SP of 1 toy = 33 rupees.<br/>
So, Gain = SP – CP = (33 – 31.25) = Rs. 1.75<br/>
and Profit % = 1.75 / 31.25 * 100 = 5.6 %</p></blockquote>

<li>A cistern can be filled by a tap in 4 hours while it can be emptied by another tap in 9 hours. If both the taps are opened simultaneously, then after how much time cistern will get filled?<br/>
a) 7 hours<br/>
b) 7.1 hours<br/>
c) 7.2 hours<br/>
d) 7.3 hours<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> 7.2 hours</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
So according to the question,<br/>
1/4 th of the cistern can be filled in one hour<br/>
1/9 th of the cistern can be emptied in 1 hour<br/>
Therfore, net filled in 1 hour = 1/4 – 1/9 = 5/36<br/>
So cistern that can be filled in 36/5 hours = 7.2 hours

<li>Find the remainder when (100!)^100 is divided by 23?<br/>
a) 3<br/>
b) 2<br/>
c) 1<br/>
d) 0<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> d) 0</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
We know that 100! = 100 * 99 * 98 * … * 23 * 22 * 21 * … * 3 * 2 * 1<br/>
So when this equation is divided by 23, the remainder is 0.</p></blockquote>

<li>One pipe can fill a bucket three times as fast as another pipe. If together the two pipes can fill the bucket in 36 minutes, then the slower pipe alone will be able to fill the bucket in:<br/>
a) 144 minutes.<br/>
b) 81 minutes.<br/>
c) 108 minutes.<br/>
d) 192 minutes.<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 144 minutes.</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let us assume that the slower pipe can fill the bucket in x minutes.<br/>
So the faster tap can feel the bucket in x/3 minutes.<br/>
According to the question,<br/>
Therefore,<br/>
1/x + x/3 = 1/36<br/>
=&gt; x = 144 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<li>Aman’s speed with the current is 15 km/hr and the speed of the current is 2.5 km/hr. What is Aman’s speed against the current?<br/>
a) 8.5 km/hr<br/>
b) 9 km/hr<br/>
c) 10 km/hr<br/>
d) 12.5 km/hr<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) 10 km/hr</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
So Aman’s rate in still water = (15 – 2.5) = 12.5 km/hr.<br/>
and Aman’s rate against the current = (12.5 – 2.5) km/hr = 10 km/hr.</p></blockquote>

<li>Seats for Mathematics, Physics and Biology in a school are in the ratio 5:7:8. There is a proposal to increase these seats by 40%, 50% and 75% respectively. What will be the ratio of increased seats?<br/>
a) 6:7:8<br/>
b) 2:3:4<br/>
c) 6:8:9<br/>
d) None of the above<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 2:3:4</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let the ratios of division be = 5x:7x:8x<br/>
There is an increase of 40%, 50% and 75% respectively.<br/>
Therefore, applying the % over the ratio we get, 7x:21x/2:14x<br/>
So, this is the required ratio.<br/>
= 14x : 21x: 28x<br/>
= 2 : 3 : 4</p></blockquote>

<li>A hollow iron pipe is 21 cm long and its external diameter is 8 cm. If the thickness of the pipe is 1 cm and iron weighs 8 g/cm3, then the weight of the pipe is:<br/>
a) 3.6 kg<br/>
b) 3.696 kg<br/>
c) 36 kg<br/>
d) 36.9 kg<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 3.696 kg</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Given the external diameter = 8 cm. Therefore, the radius = 4 cm.<br/>
The thickness = 1 cm. Therefore the internal radius = 4 – 1 = 3 cm<br/>
The volume of the iron = pi * (R^2 – r^2) * length<br/>
= 22/7 * [(4^2) – (3^2)] * 21 cubic-cm<br/>
= 462 cubic-cm<br/>
Therefore, the weight of iron = 462 * 8 gm = 3.696 kg</p></blockquote>

<li>Rohit’s father is three times elder than Rohit. After 8 years, he would be two and a half times of Rohit’s age. After a further 8 years, how many times would he be of Rohit’s age?<br/>
a) 2 times<br/>
b) 2.5 times<br/>
c) 2.75 times<br/>
d) 3 times.<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 2 times</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let Rohit present age be x years<br/>
Therefore father’s age is x + 3x = 4x years<br/>
According to the question,<br/>
4x + 8 = 5/2(x + 8)<br/>
=&gt; 3x = 24<br/>
=&gt; x = 8<br/>
So the answer is: (4x + 16) / (x + 16) = 48/24 = 2</p></blockquote>

<li>A tap can fill a bucket in 6 hours. After half the bucket is filled, three more similar taps are opened. What is the total time taken to fill the bucket completely?<br/>
a) 3 hrs 45 min<br/>
b) 3 hrs 15 min<br/>
c) 4 hrs 15 min<br/>
d) 4 hrs 45 min<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer: </strong>a) 3 hrs 45 min</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Time is taken by one tap to fill half the bucket = 3 hours<br/>
So the part filled 4 taps in one hour = 4 * (1/6) = 2/3 of the bucket.<br/>
Therefore, the remaining part is = (1 – 1/2) = 1/2<br/>
Proportinally = 2/3 : 1/2 :: 1 : x<br/>
=&gt; x = 3/4 hours = 45 minutes. So the total time = 3 hrs 45 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<li>A ship, whose speed in 15 km/hr in still water goes 30 km downstream and comes back in a total of 4 hours 30 minutes. What is the speed of the stream in km/hr?<br/>
a) 4<br/>
b) 6<br/>
c) 5<br/>
d) 10<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) 5</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let the speed of the stream be x km/hr.<br/>
Therfore the, speed of downstream = (15 + x) km/hr,<br/>
and speed of upstream = (15 – x) km/hr.<br/>
According to the question,<br/>
30/(15 + x) + 30/(15 – x) = 9/2<br/>
or, 900/(225 – x^2)    = 9/2<br/>
or, 9x^2 = 225<br/>
or, x^2 = 25<br/>
or, x = 5 km/hr.</p></blockquote>

<li>In a mixture 60 litres, the ratio of milk to water is 2:1. If this ratio is to be 1:2, then what is the quantity of water needed to be further?<br/>
a) 60 litres<br/>
b) 50 litres<br/>
c) 40 litres<br/>
d) 30 litres<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 60 litres</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
From the given ratio we can deduce the quantity of milk as = 60 * (2/3) = 40 lit<br/>
and the quantity of water = 60 – 40 = 20 lit<br/>
The new ratio must be 1:2<br/>
Let the quantity of water to be added be x lit.<br/>
Then milk:water = 40 / (20 + x)<br/>
This should be equal to = 1/2<br/>
=&gt; 20 + x = 80<br/>
or, x = 60</p></blockquote>

b) 1200<br/>
c) 900<br/>
d) 1800<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer: </strong>b) 1200</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
According to the question,<br/>
2(15 + 12)*h = 2(15 * 12)<br/>
=&gt; h = (180/27) = 20/3 meter<br/>
Therefore, the volume = l * b * h = (15 * 12 * 20/3) cubic-meter = 1200 (answer)</p></blockquote>

<li>A train running at 5 km/hr and 125 meters long passes a man moving in the same direction in which the train is going, in 10 seconds. The speed of the train is:<br/>
a) 50 km/hr<br/>
b) 54 km/hr<br/>
c) 55 km/hr<br/>
d) 60 km/hr<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) 50 km/hr</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
The relative speed of the train to man = (125 / 10) m/s<br/>
= 25 / 2 m/s<br/>
= (25/2 * 18/5) km/hr<br/>
= 45 km/hr<br/>
Let the relative speed of the train be x km/hr.<br/>
Therefore, x-45 = 5 or x = 50 km/hr</p></blockquote>

<li>In an election between two candidates, one got 55% of the total valid votes and got 20% invalid votes. At the end of the day when the total number of votes were counted, the total number was found to be 7500. So what was the total number of valid votes that the winning candidate got, was:<br/>
a) 2800<br/>
b) 3300<br/>
c) 3100<br/>
d) 2700<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer: </strong>d) 2700</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Since 20% of the votes were invalid, 80% of the votes were valid = 80% of 7500 = 6000 votes were valid<br/>
Since one candidate got 55% of the total valid votes, then the second candidate must have 45% of the votes = 0.45 * 6000 = 2700 votes</p></blockquote>

<li>January 1, 2008, is Tuesday. What day would lie on Jan 1, 2009?<br/>
a) Thursday<br/>
b) Sunday<br/>
c) Tuesday<br/>
d) Wednesday<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> a) Thursday</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
In such type of questions, one needs to identify the type of year, i.e., whether the year is a normal year or is it a leap year.<br/>
So the year 2008 was a leap year. So, it has to have 2 odd days. The year following 2008 is 2009 so the first day of the year would be two days ahead of what it was in 2008. So 1st Jan 2009 would be a Thursday.</p></blockquote>

<li>A whole number n which when divided by 4 gives 3 as remainder. What will be the remainder when 2n is divided by 4?<br/>
a) 0<br/>
b) 1<br/>
c) 2<br/>
d) 4<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> c) 2</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
According to the question,<br/>
n = 4q + 3<br/>
therefore, 2n = 8q + 6<br/>
or, 2n = 4(2q + 1 ) + 2<br/>
Thus, we get when 2n is divided by 4, the remainder is 2.</p></blockquote>

<li>In a 100 m race, Aman takes 36 seconds to complete the race and Bijay takes 45 seconds. By what distance Aman beats Bijay in the race?<br/>
a) 20 meters<br/>
b) 25 meters<br/>
c) 22.5 meters<br/>
d) 9 meters<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer:</strong> b) 20 meters</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
The difference in the time of the race completion = 45 – 36 = 9 sec.<br/>
So the distance covered by Bijay in 9 sec = 100/45 * 9 = 20 meters.<br/>
Therefore Aman beats Bijay by 20 meters</p></blockquote>

<li>X, Y and Z can do a piece of work in 20, 30 and 60 days respectively depending on their capacity of doing work. If X is assisted by Y and Z on every third day, then in how X will complete the work?<br/>
a) 12 days<br/>
b) 15 days<br/>
c) 16 days<br/>
d) 18 days<p></p>
<pre><strong>Answer: </strong>b) 15 days</pre>
<blockquote><p><strong>Solution: </strong><br/>
We need t first count the amount of work done in 2 days by X<br/>
X can do a piece of work in 20 days<br/>
So, in 2 days he can do = 1/20 * 2 = 1/10</p>
<p>Amount of work done by X, Y and Z in 1 day = 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60 = 1/10<br/>
So, amount of work done in 3 days = 1/10 + 1/10 = 1/5<br/>
So the work will be completed in  3 * 5 = 15 days.</p></blockquote>

			<p><strong>Passage:</strong><br/>
When it came to promoting its new video-game console, the Wii, in America, Nintendo recruited a handful of carefully chosen suburban mothers in the hope that they would spread the word among their friends that the Wii was a gaming console the whole family could enjoy together. Nintendo thus became the latest company to use “word-of-mouth” marketing. Nestlé, Sony and Philips have all launched similar campaigns in recent months to promote everything from bottled water to electric toothbrushes. As the power of traditional advertising declines, what was once an experimental marketing approach is becoming more popular.</p>
<p>After all, no form of advertising carries as much weight as an endorsement from a friend. “Amway and Tupperware know you can blend the social and economic to business advantage, ” says Walter Carl, a marketing guru at Northeastern University. The difference now, he says, is that the internet can magnify the effect of such endorsements.</p>
<p>The difficulty for marketers is creating the right kind of buzz and learning to control it. Negative views spread just as quickly as positive ones, so if a product has flaws, people will soon find out. And Peter Kim of Forrester, a consultancy, points out that when Microsoft sent laptops loaded with its new Windows Vista software to influential bloggers in an effort to get them to write about it, the resulting online discussion ignored Vista and focused instead on the morality of accepting gifts and the ethics of word-of-mouth marketing. Bad buzz, in short.</p>
<p>BzzAgent, a controversial company based in Boston that is one of the leading exponents of word-of-mouth marketing, operates a network of volunteer “agents” who receive free samples of products in the post. They talk to their friends about them and send back their thoughts. In return, they receive rewards through a points program—an arrangement they are supposed to make clear. This allows a firm to create buzz around a product and to see what kind of word-of-mouth response it generates, which can be useful for subsequent product development and marketing. Last week BzzAgent launched its service in Britain. Dave Balter, BzzAgent’s founder, thinks word-of-mouth marketing will become a multi-billion dollar industry. No doubt he tells that to everyone he meets.</p>

			<p><strong>Passage:</strong><br/>
Until a hundred years ago as humans, we had a simple, uncomplicated biological connect. It was a straightforward equation: we drew roughly 3, 000 calories each of energy out of the Earth for our food and life’s sustenance. Today that number per capita has grown to 1, 00, 000 calories. We still need only 3, 000 calories each to nourish life itself. All the rest of this energy is what we extract from the Earth for everything else besides keeping ourselves alive. In some countries, like the US; this per capita number runs at over 2, 00, 000 calories! Some of us are concerned about this. </p>
<p>We fret over what we could and should really be doing to soften this abuse of resources. Little things fox us in the welter of things that we get to read. What is sustainable development? How can it be started in our homes? Beyond the ceremonial planting of green arid getting people to run marathons of various lengths in support of the environment, is there- more that we can add to the abstract value of “sustainability”? What are the little things we can do in our day-to-day lives, to reduce demand for things that people make and market? Of course, we know that it helps to avoid a plastic bag when you can use a newspaper bag, or a brown bag, or even a jute bag which you can use for many more years, unlike a plastic bag which you throw away in less than a week or after a few uses. </p>
<p>However, there’s actually quite a bit more than you and I can do without compromise on comfort, with very little as cost incurred, with financial savings that you can gain on energy and water use, and with solutions that are very feasible and within your reach. It is possible to understand our ecological footprint and its disastrous consequences, not merely in terms of our own behaviour as consumers, but really in terms of the impact on the environment we make.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the primary concern of the passage?</strong><br/>
a) There is a need to save energy, especially in our future.<br/>
b) All of us should not only plant trees but also run the marathon.<br/>
c) Use of plastic bags should be completely banned.<br/>
d) We need to respect the Earth and consume less of its calories.</li>
<li><strong>Why does the author ask his audience to use a jute bag?</strong><br/>
a) Jute bags look more trendy and stylish.<br/>
b) It is the need of the hour, to save energy, to save our ecosystem.<br/>
c) Using jute bags helps in consuming only 3, 000 calories from the Earth.<br/>
d) They are more easily available.</li>
<li><strong>Which one of the following statements cannot be inferred from the passage?</strong><br/>
a) There are many little things we can do to save our Earth.<br/>
b) Only running marathons of various lengths do not help.<br/>
c) We do not depend on the Earth for our food and life sustenance.<br/>
d) A lot many years before, our association with the Nature was quite simple.</li>
<li><strong>A suitable title for the passage could be</strong><br/>
a) Lets Shift to Jute!<br/>
b) How to Consume Few Calories?<br/>
c) Save Energy, Save the Earth!<br/>
d) The Earth Heading for a Disaster.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>d) We need to respect the Earth and consume less of its calories.</li>
<li>b) It is the need of the hour, to save energy, to save our ecosystem.</li>
<li>c) We do not depend on the Earth for our food and life sustenance.</li>

			<p><strong>Passage:</strong><br/>
Sixty years ago, on the evening of August 14, 1947, a few hours before Britain’s Indian Empire was formally divided into the nation-states of India and Pakistan, Lord Louis Mountbatten and his wife, Edwina, sat down in the viceregal mansion in New Delhi to watch the latest Bob Hope movie, “My Favorite Brunette.” Large parts of the subcontinent were descending into chaos, as the implications of partitioning the Indian Empire along religious lines became clear to the millions of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs caught on the wrong side of the border. In the next few months, some twelve million people would be uprooted and as many as a million murdered. But on that night in mid-August the bloodbath—and the fuller consequences of hasty imperial retreat—still lay in the future, and the Mountbattens probably felt they had earned their evening’s entertainment.</p>
<p>Mountbatten, the last viceroy of India, had arrived in New Delhi in March 1947, charged with an almost impossible task. Irrevocably enfeebled by the Second World War, the British belatedly realized that they had to leave the subcontinent, which had spiralled out of their control through the nineteen-forties. But plans for brisk disengagement ignored messy realities on the ground. Mountbatten had a clear remit to transfer power to the Indians within fifteen months. Leaving India to God, or anarchy, as Mohandas Gandhi, the foremost Indian leader, exhorted, wasn’t a political option, however tempting. Mountbatten had to work hard to figure out how and to whom power was to be transferred.</p>
<p>The dominant political party, the Congress Party, took inspiration from Gandhi in claiming to be a secular organization, representing all four hundred million Indians. But many Muslim politicians saw it as a party of upper-caste Hindus and demanded a separate homeland for their hundred million co-religionists, who were intermingled with non-Muslim populations across the subcontinent’s villages, towns, and cities. Eventually, as in Palestine, the British saw partition along religious lines as the quickest way to the exit.<br/>
But sectarian riots in Punjab and Bengal dimmed hopes for a quick and dignified British withdrawal and boded ill for India’s assumption of power. Not surprisingly, there were some notable absences at the Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi on August 15th. Gandhi, denouncing freedom from the imperial rule as a “wooden loaf, ” had remained in Calcutta, trying, with the force of his moral authority, to stop Hindus and Muslims from killing each other. His great rival Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who had fought bitterly for a separate homeland for Indian Muslims, was in Karachi, trying to hold together the precarious nation-state of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the significance of the occasion was not lost on many. While the Mountbattens were sitting down to their Bob Hope movie, India’s constituent assembly was convening in New Delhi. The moment demanded grandiloquence, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi’s closest disciple and soon to be India’s first Prime Minister, provided it. “Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny, ” he said. “At the stroke of the midnight hour, while the world sleeps, India will awaken to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”<br/>
Posterity has enshrined this speech, as Nehru clearly intended. But today his quaint phrase “tryst with destiny” resonates ominously, so enduring has been the political and psychological scars of partition. The souls of the two new nation-states immediately found utterance in brutal enmity. In Punjab, armed vigilante groups, organized along religious lines and incited by local politicians, murdered countless people, abducting and raping thousands of women. Soon, India and Pakistan were fighting a war—the first of three—over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Gandhi, reduced to despair by the seemingly endless cycle of retaliatory mass murders and displacement, was shot dead in January 1948, by a Hindu extremist who believed that the father of the Indian nation was too soft on Muslims. Jinnah, racked with tuberculosis and overwork, died a few months later, his dream of a secular Pakistan apparently buried with him.</p>
<p>Many of the seeds of postcolonial disorder in South Asia were sown much earlier, in two centuries of direct and indirect British rule, but, a book, after the book has demonstrated, nothing in the complex tragedy of partition was inevitable. In “Indian Summer” (Henry Holt; $30), Alex von Tunzelmann pays particular attention to how negotiations were shaped by an interplay of personalities. Von Tunzelmann goes on a bit too much about the Mountbattens’ open marriage and their connections to various British royals, toffs, and fops, but her account, unlike those of some of her fellow British historians, isn’t filtered by nostalgia. She summarizes bluntly the economic record of the British overlords, who, though never as rapacious and destructive as the Belgians in the Congo, damaged agriculture and retarded industrial growth in India through a blind faith in the “invisible hand” that supposedly regulated markets. Von Tunzelmann echoes Edmund Burke’s denunciation of the East India Company when she terms the empire’s corporate forerunner a “beast” whose “the only object was money”; and she reminds readers that, in 1877, the year that Queen Victoria officially became Empress of India, a famine in the south killed five million people even as the Queen’s viceroy remained adamant that famine relief was a misguided policy.</p>
<p>Politically, too, British rule in India was deeply conservative, limiting Indian access to higher education, industry, and the civil service. Writing in the New York Tribune in the mid-nineteenth century, Karl Marx predicted that British colonials would prove to be the “unconscious tool” of a “social revolution” in a subcontinent stagnating under “Oriental despotism.” As it turned out, the British, while restricting an educated middle class, empowered a multitude of petty Oriental despots. (In 1947, there were five hundred and sixty-five of these feudatories, often called maharajas, running states as large as Belgium and as small as Central Park.)</p>

			<p><strong>Passage:</strong><br/>
The Kingdom of Spain was created in 1492 with the unification of the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of Aragon. For the next three centuries, Spain was the most important colonial power in the world. It was the most powerful state in Europe and the foremost global power during the 16th century and the greater part of the 17th century. Spain established a vast empire in the Americas, stretching from California to Patagonia, and colonies in the western Pacific.</p>
<p>Spain’s European wars, however, led to economic damage, and the latter part of the 17th century saw a gradual decline of power under an increasingly neglectful and inept Habsburg regime. The decline culminated in the War of the Spanish Succession, where Spain’s decline from the position of a leading Western power to that of a secondary one, was confirmed, although it remained the leading colonial power.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century saw a new dynasty, the Bourbons, which directed considerable effort towards the institutional renewal of the state, with some success, peaking in a successful involvement in the American War of Independence.</p>
<p>The end of the eighteenth and the start of the nineteenth centuries saw turmoil unleashed throughout Europe by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, which finally led to a French occupation of much of the continent, including Spain. This triggered a successful but devastating war of independence that shattered the country and created an opening for what would ultimately be the successful independence of Spain’s mainland American colonies.</p>
<p>Following a period of growing political instability in the early twentieth century, in 1936 Spain was plunged into a bloody civil war. The war ended in a nationalist dictatorship, led by Francisco Franco which controlled the Spanish government until 1975.</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>What is the meaning of the term <em>‘culminated’</em>?</strong><br/>
a) Follow a particular path<br/>
b) Guide or transform<br/>
c) Reach the highest point<br/>
d) Introduce on a grand scale</li>
<li><strong>What is the summary of the passage?</strong><br/>
a) The rise and fall of a national empire<br/>
b) The downfall of successive regimes in Spain<br/>
c) The history of Spain<br/>
d) Spain in eighteenth century</li>
<li><strong>What occurred in the latter part of 17th century?</strong><br/>
a) War of succession confirmed the leading position of Spain<br/>
b) Spain was no longer regarded as the ruling colonial power<br/>
c) A vast empire was established in Europe<br/>

			<p><strong>Passage:</strong><br/>
The economic transformation of India is one of the great business stories of our time. As <em>stifling</em> government regulations have been lifted, entrepreneurship has flourished, and the country has become a high-powered centre for information technology and pharmaceuticals. Indian companies like Infosys and Wipro are powerful global players, while Western firms like G.E. and I.B.M. now have major research facilities in India employing thousands. India’s seemingly endless flow of young, motivated engineers, scientists, and managers offering developed-world skills at developing-world wages is held to be putting American jobs at risk, and the country is frequently heralded as “the next economic superpower.”</p>
<p>But India has run into a surprising hitch on its way to superpower status: its inexhaustible supply of workers is becoming exhausted. Although India has one of the youngest workforces on the planet, the head of Infosys said recently that there was an “acute shortage of skilled manpower,” and a study by Hewitt Associates projects that this year salaries for skilled workers will rise fourteen and a half per cent, a sure sign that demand for skilled labor is outstripping supply.</p>
<p>How is this possible in a country that every year produces two and a half million college graduates and four hundred thousand engineers? Start with the fact that just ten per cent of Indians get any kind of post-secondary education, compared with some fifty per cent who do in the U.S. Moreover, of that ten per cent, the vast majority go to one of India’s seventeen thousand colleges, many of which are closer to community colleges than to four-year institutions. India does have more than three hundred universities, but a recent survey by the London Times Higher Education Supplement put only two of them among the top hundred in the world. Many Indian graduates, therefore, enter the workforce with a low level of skills. A current study led by Vivek Wadhwa, of Duke University, has found that if you define “engineer” by U.S. standards, India produces just a hundred and seventy thousand engineers a year, not four hundred thousand. Infosys says that, of 1.3 million applicants for jobs last year, it found only two per cent acceptable.</p>
<p>There was a time when many economists believed that post-secondary education didn’t have much impact on economic growth. The really important educational gains, they thought, came from giving rudimentary skills to large numbers of people (which India still needs to do—at least thirty per cent of the population is illiterate). They believed that, in economic terms, society got a very low rate of return on its investment in higher education. But lately that assumption has been overturned, and the social rate of return on investment in university education in India has been calculated at an impressive nine or ten per cent. In other words, every dollar India puts into higher education creates value for the economy as a whole. Yet India spends roughly three and a half per cent of its G.D.P. on education, significantly below the percentage spent by the U.S., even though India’s population is much younger, and spending on education should be proportionately higher.</p>
<p>The irony of the current situation is that India was once considered to be overeducated. In the seventies, as its economy languished, it seemed to be a country with too many engineers and Ph.D.s working as clerks in government offices. Once the Indian business climate loosened up, though, that meant companies could tap a backlog of hundreds of thousands of eager, skilled workers at their disposal. Unfortunately, the educational system did not adjust to the new realities. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of teachers in India actually fell, while the percentage of students enrolled in high school or college rose more slowly than it did in the rest of the world. Even as the need for skilled workers was increasing, India was devoting relatively fewer resources to producing them.</p>
<p>Since the Second World War, the countries that have made successful leaps from developing to developed status have all poured money, public and private, into education. South Korea now spends a higher percentage of its national income on education than nearly any other country in the world. Taiwan had a system of universal primary education before its phase of hypergrowth began. And, more recently, Ireland’s economic boom was spurred, in part, by an opening up and expansion of primary and secondary schools and increased funding for universities. Education will be all the more important for India’s well-being; the earlier generation of so-called Asian Tigers depended heavily on manufacturing, but India’s focus on services and technology will require a more skilled and educated workforce.</p>
<p>India has taken tentative steps to remedy its skills famine—the current government has made noises about doubling spending on education, and a host of new colleges and universities have sprung up since the mid-nineties. But India’s impressive economic performance has made the problem seem less urgent than it actually is, and allowed the government to defer difficult choices. (In a country where more than three hundred million people live on a dollar a day, producing college graduates can seem like a low priority.) Ultimately, the Indian government has to pull off a very tough trick, making serious changes at a time when things seem to be going very well. It needs, in other words, a clear sense of everything that can still go wrong. The paradox of the Indian economy today is that the more certain its glowing future seems to be, the less likely that future becomes</p>
